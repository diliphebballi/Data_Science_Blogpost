# Data_Science_Blogpost
This repository is for the Udacity project 'Write a Data Science Blog Post'

# Project Motivation
This project is a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nano degree program. This project demonstrates the ability to answer few questions that may arise from the dataset and try to provide answer to those questions through a blog post.

For this project we will be using Seattle Airbnb Open data. This data can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle

We will also be writing a blog post as a part of this project. The potential hosts (people who want to add their property on Airbnb) can have a look st this blog post and get an idea of the existing market.

To help them we will be looking at the following:
1) What are the most popular property types in Seattle?
2) How does the neighbourhood affect the proprty prices of the most popular properties?
3) What factors affect the price of a property most?

The findings of this analysis can be found in the blog post: https://diliphebballi.medium.com/a-look-at-seattle-housing-data-on-airbnb-ba41a3e495b4

# Summary of analysis
The 3 things that can be taken away from this analysis is:
1) The most popular property types in Seattle are Houses and Apartments.
2) The property owner might need to consider the mean prices of the popular property types in different neighborhoods before listing them.
3) The top 5 factors that affect the price of a property are found and the property owner can get a better price for their property if they consider altering their property (increasing the number of beds and hence increasing the number of people the property accommodates)

# Libraries
The following libraries are used in the notebook:
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib.pyplot
4) seaborn

# Files
