This repository is for the Udacity project 'Write a Data Science Blog Post'

# Project Motivation
This project is a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nano degree program. This project demonstrates the ability to answer few questions that may arise from the dataset and try to provide answer to those questions through a blog post.
