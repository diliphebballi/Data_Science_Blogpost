# Data_Science_Blogpost
This repository is for the Udacity project 'Write a Data Science Blog Post'

# Project Motivation
This project is a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nano degree program. This project demonstrates the ability to answer few questions that may arise from the dataset and try to provide answer to those questions through a blog post.

For this project we will be using Seattle Airbnb Open data. This data can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle

We will also be writing a blog post as a part of this project. The potential hosts (people who want to add their property on Airbnb) can have a look st this blog post and get an idea of the existing market.

To help them we will be looking at the following:
1) What are the most popular property types in Seattle?
2) How does the neighbourhood affect the proprty prices of the most popular properties?
3) What factors affect the price of a property most?

The findings of this analysis can be found in the blog post: https://diliphebballi.medium.com/a-look-at-seattle-housing-data-on-airbnb-ba41a3e495b4
